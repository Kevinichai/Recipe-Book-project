# Recipe-Book-project
# Learning Outcomes
Implement a 'mini' web application using JavaScript.
This project is meant to showcase a mini web application encoded with data from a provided publicly accessible Api, particularly one that allows the user to view recipes and meals.

# Required Deliverables 
The deliverables for said project are as follows:
. Your app must be a HTML/CSS/JS frontend that accesses data from a public API or from a db.json file using json-server. Your API or db.json should return a collection of at least 5 objects with each object having at least 3 attributes. All interactions between the client and the API should be handled asynchronously and use JSON as the communication format. Try to avoid using an API that requires a key. APIs that are free and require no authorization will be easiest to use. For ideas, see this list of no-auth APIsLinks to an external site.. If you would like to use an API that requires a key, please consult with your instructor on how to protect that key. NEVER push your API key to github!

. Your entire app must run on a single page. There should be NO redirects or reloads. In other words, your project will contain a single HTML file.

. Use at least 3 distinct event listenersLinks to an external site. (3 events of different types) that enable interactivity. What this means is that, if you had 3 click events, that would only count as 1 distinct event and you would need to add at least 2 more. Think search or filter functionality, toggling dark/light mode, upvoting posts, etc. Each of your event listeners should also have its own unique callback function. These must be added using JavaScript's .addEventListener() method. Events embedded into HTML elements and CSS will not count toward the total. Please ask your instructor if you have questions regarding this requirement.

. Your project must implement at least one instance of array iteration using available array methods (map, forEach, filter, etc). Manipulating your API data in some way should present an opportunity to implement your array iteration.

. Follow good coding practices. Keep your code DRY (Do not repeat yourself) by utilizing functions to abstract repetitive code.

# Description
*The project shows various recipe titles upon request in the input field.
*It allows the user to get acces to various recipe suggestions,once the user requests for a given ingredient or meal name.
*It is linked to the mealDb api where it sources its primary data.

*The project requires prior knowledge on the use of the fetch method which helps one to access resources from a server in this case a .json server.

*The project also demands that a user is equipped on the use of functions and eventlisteners in the configuration of web applications using javascript.

# Pre-Requisites.
*For one to be able to run this code they would need to have the following requirements:

A machine that runs on Windows 7+,Linux or Mac OS.
Nodejs 10.0+
A valid code editor such as VS Code or an online code editor such as Codepen

# Installation
In order to be able to access this repository,there are a variety of steps one can take.

Alternative One

Open a terminal / command line interface on your local machine(computer)

Clone the repository holding this project by using the input: https://github.com/Kevinichai/Recipe-Book-project.git

Wait for the sequence to run until it successfully clones the repository on your local machine

Navigate to the repo folder using the cd function

Open the repository on an editor of your choice(preferably Visual Studio Code)

You have successfully cloned this repo and can now navigate its contents

Alternative Two

Make your way to the repository main page and press the fork button

This allows you to fork the repo to your individual github account from where you can use the first alternative to successfuly install this repo.

Also to interact with the web application, kindly visit this link:https://recipe-book-project-seven.vercel.app/

# Running and editing the Programming languages
*In order for one to successfully run these programs, a recent version of node.js is required. If the application is not installed use the command nvm install followed by the version required for use.So as to ensure that the version used is the one installed run the command,nvm use followed by the version of node installed. So as to avoid blockers and issues kindly use node from version 10 onwards.To check what node version is in use on your machine, run the command node-v on your terminal or command line interface.
